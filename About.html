               <h5>Jugra Hill, Banting</h5>
               <p>
                  Malaysia is home to a plethora of well-known resorts, tried-and-true weekend getaways, and well-known tourist attractions. But if you're searching for a less-known vacation spot, or a chance to have a little fun with a twist without breaking the bank, consider Jugra. It's reasonable to say that many individuals have no idea where this is.This unspoiled natural haven has become a local getaway from the city for people who seek both peace and excitement. Located south of Port Klang on the Peninsula's west coast, nestled across the Langat River (or narrow strait) from Carey Island and just a short drive from the centre of Banting, this unspoiled natural haven has become a local getaway from the city for people who seek both peace and excitement.

                  Jugra has plenty of opportunities for healthy physical activity as well as unspoiled areas where visitors may relax and appreciate nature while breathing in the fresh sea breeze. The sights here have captivated many visitors, from the spectacular views from Bukit Jugra (Jugra Hill) to the fascinating historical Jugra Insitu Museum (Old Police Station and Jail Museum) and the reverent calm of the old Sultan Abdul Samad Mausoleum. Jugra is still largely obscure outside of this district to this day.

               <h5>Bukit Jugra Lighthouse, Banting</h5>
               <p>
                  The Bukit Jugra Lighthouse, located in the Malaysian province of Selangor, is a must-see site. The Bukit Jugra Lighthouse, which was built in1976, has acted as a marker for ships arriving at port and is also a great place for tourists to visit. Hike to the location and, if you're up for it, climb to the top of the lighthouse to take in the panoramic view, which is a once-in-a-lifetime event.Paragliding is also available at a reasonable price from the base of the Bukit Jugra Lighthouse.

               <h5>About Jugra Hill</h5>
               <p>
                  Jugra was the royal capital of Selangor in the late 1800s, and its well-preserved buildings are good representations of the craftsmanship and majesty of its illustrious history. Bukit Jugra, also known as Jugra Hill, is still a famous tourist destination today, but for different reasons. It's ideal for outdoor activities like hiking and paragliding because of its undulating landscape and stunning views. Jugra, like Tanjung Sepat, is a popular culinary stopover and is famous for â€˜Beggar's Chicken,' an old Chinese dish produced by baking whole chickens and herbs wrapped in lotus leaves in traditional brick kilns.
